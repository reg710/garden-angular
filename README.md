# Garden Angular

I'd like to build something to help me answer the question I ask myself all spring and summer long - should I water my garden today?


## Goals

Because my plan is to finish this project over a weekend, I'm trying to add complexity in stages as time allows. Below are my initial stage outlines and I'll be keeping progress [notes](notes.md).

- Basic
    - Enter zip code
    - Use weather API to return past 3 days of precipitation
    - Display verdict on whether or not to water
    - Style
    - Add test suite(s)

- Add database
    - Connect with mongoDB
    - Populate db with plants and their water neediness levels
    - Allow users to add/edit/delete plants

- Jazz up predictions
    - Consider additional API to incorporate forecast into answer
    - Add component to visualize weather data (chart? calendar?)

- Add users
    - Add user signup/authentication process
    - Allow users to save information specific to their own gardens
